# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance an online retail company's overall performance in the competitive retail market. In this project, I am working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.

Using exploratory data analysis, my goal is to provide insights into the store's sales trends such as the busiest sales months, customer behavior such as the store's most valuable customers, and popular products.

## Dataset

The dataset is available as a .xlsx file and can also be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx).
